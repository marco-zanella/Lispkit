# Lispkit
Lisp-like functional programming language created for the course of Programming Languages for my Master degree in Computer Science.

In this project a compiler and an abstract machine for the Lispkit language are implemented in Haskell. Project specification, as well as Lispkit grammar and semantics, were given by intructor.

The resource folder also contain a (partial) implementation in ML from previous years of the same course.
