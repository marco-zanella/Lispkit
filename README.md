# Lispkit
Lisp-like functional programming language created for the course of Programming Languages for my Master degree in Computer Science.

In this project a compiler and an abstract machine for the Lispkit language are implemented in Haskell. Project specification, as well as Lispkit grammar and semantics, were given by intructor.
